    "Topography is an essential input to any storm surge or other GeoClaw simulation.  There are multiple places to find topography, most notably the **INPUT SUGGESTION**.  One thing to keep in mind however is that the accuracy of any simulation is highly dependent on the resolution of the topography used, especially near the coast.  In GeoClaw we need topography to cover the entire domain but you can provide multiple, overlapping topography files that can cover different parts of the domain.  This is useful when you need to cover a large domain but only are concerned with the region surrounding the landfall region.  In the case of GeoClaw finer topography does incur a computational cost so there is an advantage to only providing fine topography where it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we need topography that will cover the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and out to the Atlantic Ocean.  In this case we have pre-fetched some data for you that covers the domain specified **MENTION DOMAIN** along with the region surrounding New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general things to keep in mind when providing topography:\n",
    " - Topography can overlap and you can also specify at which level each topography file is used\n",

In GeoClaw the storm is specified by a time point and a number of storm parameters such as maximum wind speed and minimum pressure that then reconstructs a parameterized version of the storm.  From this the simulation knows what the wind and pressure field looks like at arbitrary times and spatial points.  Currently HURDAT is the only supported format however there are currently PRs to incorporate the new HURDAT2 format, the JMA format, the IMD format, and easily incorporate other similar formats as well as other parameterized hurricanes beyond the Holland model."
